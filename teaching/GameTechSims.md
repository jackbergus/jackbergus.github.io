     I.  Probability in Game Design ([Slides](https://github.com/jackbergus/NCL_CSC3232/blob/main/slides/1_a_probability.pdf), Code: [C#](https://github.com/jackbergus/NCL_CSC3232/blob/main/csharp/ConsoleApp2/probabilities/Probabilities.cs), [C++](https://github.com/jackbergus/NCL_CSC3232/tree/main/cpp/01_probability))
     
     II.  From Probability to Navigation ([Slides](https://github.com/jackbergus/NCL_CSC3232/blob/main/slides/1_b_stochastic.pdf))
     
     III. From Navigation to Analysis ([Slides](https://github.com/jackbergus/NCL_CSC3232/blob/main/slides/1_c_goap.pdf))
