# Research Projects

I am interested in very theoretical research projects having an immediate fallback in practical use case scenarios. Some of my interests are the following:

 * **Theoretical Background**:
   - (Relational) Database Theory (modeling, query languages)
   - Conformance Checking and Trace Alignments
   - Graph Theory and Query
   - Inconsistency Metrics
 * **Practical Use Case Scenarios**:
   - VideoGame User Experience
   - Recommendation Systems



# Projects as a Student
As a Graduate (G), Undergraduate (U), and PhD (P) student, I developped the following code:

   * (P) As a visiting Ph.D. student at the Universität Leipzig, I contribute to the FOSS [Gradoop](http://www.gradoop.org) project with [my own fork](https://github.com/jackbergus/gradoop). I'll implement some graph operators.
   * (P) [DISeASE](http://github.com/jackbergus/DISeASE): Implementing The Watson Project from scratch for ICD-9-CM codes recognition (feat. *Alexander Pollok*) 
   * (G) A [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/)'s [extension](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B15ik0F3-2nGS0trUWh3a1dYdVU/edit) showing the occurring communications between the agents, using [GraphStream](http://graphstream-project.org/) (feat. *[Giulio Biagini](https://it.linkedin.com/in/giulio-biagini-090915167)* and *[Gianluca Iselli](https://it.linkedin.com/in/gianlucaiselli)*). With the same group I coded an [Omnet++ simulation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwq22m342nk2snf/Gruppo-Bergami-Biagini-Iselli.tar.gz?dl=1) implementing a P2P algorithm, using C++11 and GraphBoost Library
   * (G) [SocialSim](https://github.com/jackbergus/socialsim): a dynamic (Social) Network Simulator using both agent model and event model simulation  (feat. *[Elena Tea Russo](https://it.linkedin.com/in/elenatearusso)*).
   * (U) [Amppercent7](https://github.com/jackbergus/Amppercent7): a Multi-Chat Project developed with Android SDK and Beem-Asmack library.
   * (U) [UMView with Guardian Angels](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p843q3gvq6xln08/pxmview.tar.gz?dl=1): an implenentation of the “Guardian Angels” technique inside the UMView SystemCall Virtual Machine. [More details](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~renzo/vsd/angels_n_taxi) (feat. *[Gianluca Iselli](https://it.linkedin.com/in/gianlucaiselli)* and *[Matteo Martelli](https://it.linkedin.com/in/matteo-martelli-7350867a?trk=people-guest_people_search-card)*)
   * (U) [Orthopediatrics](https://github.com/FMP196/Orthopediatrics): an undergraduate project for the Software Engineering course. It uses Easier Java Persistence (EJP) for persistence issues. (feat. *[Fabian Priftaj](https://github.com/FMP196)*, *Matej Torok* and *[Paolo de Luca](https://it.linkedin.com/in/paolo-de-luca-b07a07a5)*)
   * (U) [Proxy miniHTTP/miniHTML with prefetching](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k0g5nxe9ixplu77/last.zip?dl=1): an implementation of a multithreaded sytstem for caching purposes with time-validity checking.


## Code Snippets

As a student, I wrote a lot of very short projects. Those are:

   * Running an R-script [as a daemon](https://gist.github.com/jackbergus/800ca4f4a17af69dc840)
   * [loaderPlugin](https://github.com/jackbergus/loaderPlugin): a single-header library used in SocialSim for defining a PlugIn repository
   * How-To on [implementing iterators](https://gist.github.com/jackbergus/9387426) on C++11
   * [krouter](https://github.com/jackbergus/krouter): implements a Omnet++ router that emits packets to k different ports with different assigned probabilities
   * [parse_commands_http](https://gist.github.com/jackbergus/5950137): parses http headers in C++11
   * [block_tcp](https://github.com/jackbergus/block_tcp): given a list of IPs and URLs, blocks incoming and outcoming TCP packets
   * [Cleaner.py](https://github.com/jackbergus/GeneralPythonScripts/blob/master/cleaner.py): a Python scripts that removes e-mail from known spammers or social networks.
