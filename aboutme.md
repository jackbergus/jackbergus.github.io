My full name's [pronunciation](https://jackbergus.alwaysdata.net/play.html) in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) is [ˈd͡ʒaːkomo ˈbe:rgami].

I am a PostDoc Researcher at the [University of Florida](https://directory.ufl.edu/indv/WIDDBOTREDERZ&f=&l=Bergami&e=&a=staff) at the UF Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering, CISE Department.

I received my Bachelor Degree (110/110, summa cum Laude) from Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna University on the 13th November, 2012. The Bachelor Thesis,  “[PjProject su Android: Uno scontro su più livelli](http://amslaurea.unibo.it/4441/1/bergami_giacomo_tesi.pdf)” (en. PjProject on Android: a clash on multiple layers), was supervised by prof. [Vittorio Ghini](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~ghini/); it addressed a feasibility study on porting native Linux applications using the [pjsip stack](http://www.pjsip.org/) on Android: in order to check that, I had to study the whole interaction between Java application and native libraries through the so-called [Android Middleware (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/source/).

I received my Master Degree (110/110, summa cum Laude) from Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna University on the 17th July, 2014 (first graduation session) with a tesis called “[Hypergraph Mining in Social Networks](http://amslaurea.unibo.it/7106/1/main.pdf)“, supervised by prof. [Danilo Montesi](http://cs.unibo.it/~montesi); it addessed for the first time an data mining relational algebra for hypergraphs, that had the aim to logically define Data Mining operations and metric over OSNs (On-Line Social Networks).

From the 1st of November 2014 to the 1st of November 2017, I was a PhD Candidate at [Bologna University, Italy](http://www.unibo.it), [CSE Dept.](http://www.informatica.unibo.it/it), School of Sciences. Prof. Danilo Montesi was my PhD supervisor. [My PhD thesis](https://amsdottorato.unibo.it/8348/1/bergami_giacomo_tesi.pdf) focused on two novel graph operators: graph joins (for combining data) and graph nesting (for structural aggregations). These two operators were inserted in a broader data integration scenario, that was presented in my thesis defense. I finally obtained my PhD the 20th of April, 2018.
