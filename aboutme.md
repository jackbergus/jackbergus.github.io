![me @my desk!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackbergus/jackbergus.github.io/master/img/20210714_190758.jpg)

My full name's [pronunciation](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88d%CA%92a%CB%90komo%20%CB%88be%3Argami&voice=Carla) in [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) is [ˈd͡ʒaːkomo ˈbe:rgami], and I am a [Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Game Technology at Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/profile/giacomobergami.html).

I received my Bachelor Degree (110/110, summa cum Laude) from Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna University on the 13th November, 2012. The Bachelor Thesis,  “[PjProject su Android: Uno scontro su più livelli](http://amslaurea.unibo.it/4441/1/bergami_giacomo_tesi.pdf)” (en. PjProject on Android: a clash on multiple layers), was supervised by prof. **Vittorio Ghini** [[1]](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~ghini/)[[2]](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~ghini/didattica/sistemimobili/BergamiGiacomo/index.html); it addressed a feasibility study on porting native Linux applications using the [pjsip stack](http://www.pjsip.org/) on Android: in order to check that, I had to study the whole interaction between Java application and native libraries through the so-called [Android Middleware (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/source/).

I received my Master Degree (110/110, summa cum Laude) from Alma Mater Studiorum, Bologna University on the 17th July, 2014 (first graduation session) with a tesis called “[Hypergraph Mining in Social Networks](http://amslaurea.unibo.it/7106/1/main.pdf)“, supervised by prof. [Danilo Montesi](http://cs.unibo.it/~montesi); it addessed for the first time an data mining relational algebra for hypergraphs, that had the aim to logically define Data Mining operations and metric over OSNs (On-Line Social Networks).

From the 1st of November 2014 to the 1st of November 2017, I was a PhD Candidate at [Bologna University, Italy](http://www.unibo.it), [CSE Dept.](http://www.informatica.unibo.it/it), School of Sciences. Prof. Danilo Montesi was my PhD supervisor. [My PhD thesis](https://amsdottorato.unibo.it/8348/1/bergami_giacomo_tesi.pdf) focused on two novel graph operators: graph joins (for combining data) and graph nesting (for structural aggregations). These two operators were inserted in a broader data integration scenario, that was presented in my thesis defense. I finally obtained my PhD the 20th of April, 2018.
